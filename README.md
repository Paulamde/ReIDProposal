# ReIDProposal

This github includes the code for the proposals to the AI City Challenge 2020 and the Unsupervise Domain Adaptation for the AI City Challenge 2021 dataset in CIARP 2023 Conference.

## Code

This porposal utilizes two open-source state-of-the-art works:

1. [Image-based module](https://github.com/Simon4Yan/feature_learning/tree/master/Feature_Learning)
2. [Clip-based module](https://github.com/ipl-uw/2019-CVPR-AIC-Track-2-UWIPL/blob/master/Video-Person-ReID/README.md)


### Modified Codes
This includes modified codes to integrate the proposed system with the previous codes.
1. code_imagepath: Change the codes from the [Image-based module](https://github.com/Simon4Yan/feature_learning/tree/master/Feature_Learning) with the included in this folder.
2. code_videopath: Change the codes from the [Clip-based module](https://github.com/ipl-uw/2019-CVPR-AIC-Track-2-UWIPL/blob/master/Video-Person-ReID/README.md) with the included in this folder.


## UDA
This technique is implemented just with the three models of the Image-based module and the CityFlow-ReID-v2. Include the codes of UDA folder to  [Image-based module](https://github.com/Simon4Yan/feature_learning/tree/master/Feature_Learning).
